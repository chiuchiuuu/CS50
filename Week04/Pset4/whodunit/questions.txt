1.  stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library. It declares sets of integer types having specified widths, and defines 
    corresponding sets of macros. It also defines macros that specify limits of integer types corresponding to types defined in 
    other standard headers.
2.  declare sets of integer types having specified widths. Using well-defined types makes the code far easier and safer to port 
    since you won't get any surprises when one machine interprets int as 16-bit and another as 32-bit. What you type is what you 
    get when you use them.
3.  1, 4, 4, 2
4.  bfType
5.  bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file. biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure.
6.  the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
7.  biBitCount
8.  user may input a wrong file name so that fopen() can't find that file and return NULL
9.  because we want to read one structure at a time
10. 3
11. if there are paddings, skip over them i.e. change the pointer to the next RGBTRIPLE structure.
12. the current location of the file pointer
